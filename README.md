# Inverse-Kinematics-Cat
Excersize in sprite kit testing inverse kinematics tribal cat that wiggles its tail and looks at places tapped on screen.  
It is based on 2D skinning animation technique with programatically created and controlled skeleton.  Cat is made of some tribal tattoo art I borrowed online and split into limbs.
Inverse Kinematics is a mathematical technique that in my case makes position and animation calculation for Cat's skeleton to reach a certain point on the screen.  Done in Swift 2 so most code is depricated.
